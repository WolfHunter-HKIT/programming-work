                        liver disease</h3>
                </header>
                <p>In a recent study published in BMC Public Health, researchers investigated how the combined impact of
                    lifestyle factors and ambient air pollution affects the risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver
                    disease (NAFLD).</p>
                <p>Their results indicate that while unhealthy lifestyles and exposure to air pollutants over long
                    periods significantly increase the risk of NAFLD, unfavorable lifestyle factors may influence the
                    effect of air pollution.</p>

                    <h3>Study reveals gaps in Alzheimer's knowledge</h3>
                </header>
                <p>A new study examining older Black Americans' perceptions of Alzheimer's disease has found a lack of
                    awareness of the devastating condition. The authors propose strategies for supporting brain health
                    in this population.</p>
                <p>Absence of awareness of Alzheimer's disease may undermine Black Americans' ability to identify
                    potential risk of the disease and its impact on their community, said Johanne Eliacin, PhD,
                    Regenstrief Institute, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Indiana University School of
                    Medicine research scientist and study leader. Dr. Eliacin notes that the research team's findings
                    may contribute to the development of effective and culturally sensitive strategies to address racial
                    disparities in Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                    </h3>
                </header>
                <p>AF, a common cardiac condition associated with an irregular heart rate, is estimated to affect over
                    33 million adults worldwide. The presence of AF increases the risk of stroke, heart failure,
                    cognitive dysfunction, and premature death.</p>
                <p>Smartwatches and fitness bands are common wearable devices used by AF patients to continuously
                    monitor vital health parameters such as stress, physical activity, weight, heart rate, and sleep
                    patterns. Several commercially available wearable devices, such as the Apple Watch, are equipped
                    with medical-grade sensors and software to monitor irregular heartbeats associated with AF. Some of
                    these devices also generate single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data and have been approved by the
                    United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medical use.</p>

                    <h3>Adopting a healthy lifestyle boosts life expectancy and cuts healthcare costs</h3>
                </header>
                <p>The associations between unhealthy lifestyle factors and the risk of chronic diseases and mortality
                    have been well-established in the literature. Adopting an unhealthy lifestyle, including
                    poor-quality diet, physical inactivity, smoking, and heavy alcohol drinking, has been found to be
                    associated with 60% of all premature deaths worldwide.</p>
                <p>An increase in average life expectancy has been observed globally in recent decades. However, it
                    remains uncertain whether increased life expectancy is associated with an overall reduction in
                    healthcare costs. Several studies have highlighted associations between lifestyle risk factors and
                    healthcare-related economic burden.</p>

                <p>A study led by the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC) and Fundaci√≥n SHE,
                    supported by "la Caixa" Foundation, demonstrates that teaching healthy habits through classroom
                    activities helps to prevent the accumulation of abdominal fat during the first school years.</p>
                <p>The study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), is one of the
                    largest contemporary school-based health promotion studies and has one of the most extensive
                    participant follow-up schedules.</p>

                    <h3>Study finds diabetes linked to accelerated brain aging, but healthy habits can help</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Diabetes is a significant risk factor for dementia, although its impact on early brain aging is
                    unknown. Diabetes has been related to global brain shrinkage, an increased burden of small-vessel
                    disease, and microstructural lesions before cognitive symptoms, according to magnetic resonance
                    imaging (MRI).</p>
                <p>Prediabetes has been associated with mild cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative abnormalities,
                    although its relationship with cognitive decline and dementia is debatable.</p>
                <p>The brain age gap (BAG) signifies a divergence from normal aging, which increases the risk of
                    cognitive decline and dementia.</p>
                <p>Early diagnosis of accelerated brain aging might aid in the prompt identification and management of
                    persons at risk for dementia. However, longitudinal evidence on the link between prediabetes and
                    brain age is limited, and lifestyle choices may impact the relationship.</p>
